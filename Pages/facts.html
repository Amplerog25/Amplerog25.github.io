<h2>Here is a few facts about the pugs you might like to learn:</h2>
<p>The earliest records of the Pug come from China, where Pugs were pets in Tibetan Buddhist monasteries.</p>
<p>As you can see from the image above. Originally pugs had <Strong> long legs, longer noses,and a slim build</Strong>. However, they've been bred over time to have shorter legs, flatter noses, curly tails and a stockier build. The paiting name “A favourite Pug” painted by
Henry Bernard Chalon was made in <Strong>1802</Strong>. It shows how selective breeding had changed the pug as we know them today.</P>
